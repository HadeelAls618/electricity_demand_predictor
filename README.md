# Hourly Electricity Demand Prediction Service

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end, production-ready electricity demand forecasting system designed to optimize energy supply, reduce operational costs, and minimize CO₂ emissions for **Public Energy Company**. Utilizing MLOps best practices, the solution is fully automated, integrating data collection, feature engineering, model training, inference, and continuous monitoring into a seamless ML pipeline.

## Business Problem

Public Energy Company encounters several operational challenges in managing electricity supply across various NYC locations:

* **Overproduction**: Generating excess electricity, leading to increased costs and energy waste.
* **Shortages**: Underestimating peak demand, causing power outages and lowering customer satisfaction.
* **Resource Misallocation**: Inefficient distribution of electricity resources, impacting operational efficiency and increasing the carbon footprint.

These issues lead to higher operational expenses, reduced profitability, and lower customer satisfaction.

## ML Problem

Accurately predict electricity demand for the next hour to align energy generation with forecasted demand. This ensures optimal resource allocation, enhances operational efficiency, and improves customer satisfaction.

## Data Sources

To ensure accurate predictions, we use multiple data sources:

* **Historical Electricity Demand Data**: Fetched from the **[EIA API](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/)**.
* **Weather Data**: Historical weather information retrieved from the **[Open-Meteo Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/)**.
* **Calendar Events**: Public holidays extracted using `pandas.tseries.holiday`.

## Project Methodology

Our methodology features a three-stage ML pipeline, leveraging modern MLOps principles such as feature stores, model registries, and automated inference to ensure scalability and reliability.

### **1. Feature Pipeline**

This pipeline fetches and preprocesses the required data, transforms it into a time-series format, and stores it in the **Hopsworks Feature Store**.

#### **Steps:**

1. Fetch historical electricity demand data from the **EIA API**.
2. Fetch historical weather data (temperature) from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
3. Merge data sources based on timestamps.
4. Transform data into time-series format.
5. Store transformed data in the Hopsworks Feature Store.

### **2. Training Pipeline**

This pipeline fetches data from the feature store, processes it into a feature-target format, trains a machine learning model, and evaluates it before saving the trained model in the **Hopsworks Model Registry**.

#### **Steps:**

1. Load preprocessed time-series data from the feature store.
2. Transform data into features and target:

   * **Prediction Target**: Hourly electricity demand for NYC.
   * **Features**:

     * Hourly temperature in NYC.
     * Lag-based features.
3. Train a **LightGBM model** with hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna** and 5-fold cross-validation.
4. Implement **feature engineering**:

   * Add US federal holidays using `pandas.tseries.holiday`.
   * Incorporate time-series features (lags, rolling statistics).
5. Evaluate the model using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
6. Store the trained model in the **Hopsworks Model Registry**.

### **3. Inference Pipeline**

This pipeline is responsible for generating hourly electricity demand predictions using the trained model from the model registry and the features from the feature store.

#### **Steps:**

1. Fetch the latest feature set from the Hopsworks Feature Store.
2. Load the trained model from the **Hopsworks Model Registry**.
3. Generate hourly demand predictions.
4. Compare predictions against actual demand data to compute **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
5. The pipeline runs as a **serverless function in `inference_pipeline.py`**, scheduled via **GitHub Actions** to execute every hour.

## Deployment & Monitoring

We developed **two interactive Streamlit applications** for batch demand forecasting and model performance monitoring.

### **Batch Demand Forecasting App**

* A **Streamlit application** visualizes forecasted electricity demand for different locations in NYC.
* The application features an interactive **map**, where the size of circles represents demand at specific locations.
* Users can explore electricity demand variations across locations in real-time.

### **Monitoring Dashboard**

* A separate **Streamlit dashboard** monitors model performance on an hourly basis.
* The dashboard includes:

  * A real-time chart of **MAE trends**.
  * Historical performance records.
  * Comparison of predicted vs. actual demand.
This allows continuous monitoring and optimization of the model.

## Summary

This project successfully implements a prediction system for hourly electricity demand forecasting. By leveraging machine learning, the Public Energy Company can optimize energy production and improve efficiency while minimizing costs, achieving the following goals:

* **Automated ML Pipeline** → Fully automated process from data collection to inference.
* **Feature Store & Model Registry** → Efficient feature storage and model versioning.
* **Batch Demand Forecasting** → Predicts hourly electricity demand across locations.
* **Interactive App** → Provides easy-to-interpret forecasts and model insights.
* **Production-Ready** → Scheduled batch inference, model monitoring and retraining, and scalable architecture.
